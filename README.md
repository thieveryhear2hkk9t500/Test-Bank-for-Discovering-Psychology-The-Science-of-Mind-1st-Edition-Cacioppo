  * * Author: Laura A. Freberg
   
  * In this fresh new offering to the Intro Psychology course, authors John Cacioppo and Laura Freberg portray psychology as being an integrative science in two ways. First, they have written a text that reflects psychology's rightful place as a hub science that draws from and is cited by research in many other fields. Second, this text presents psychology as a unified science that seeks a complete understanding of the human mind, rather than as a loosely organized set of autonomous subspecialties. As psychology moves rapidly toward maturity as an integrative, multidisciplinary field, the introductory course offers an opportunity to teach all of psychology in one place and at one time. This text reflects that evolution--and the authors' excitement about it.
